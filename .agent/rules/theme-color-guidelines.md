# Color Usage Rules

## Core Principle
Always prioritize visual comfort, consistency, and neutrality. The interface should feel calm, modern, and intentional, not loud or harsh.

## Neutral-Only by Default
- **Always use the neutral color palette** for backgrounds, text, borders, and surfaces.
- Neutrals are the foundation of the UI. They control hierarchy, contrast, and readability.
- The **only non-neutral color allowed is the provided accent color**, and it should be used sparingly for emphasis, actions, or highlights.

## No Pure Black
- **Never use pure black (#000000).**
- Pure black creates excessive contrast, eye strain, and a harsh visual tone.
- For dark backgrounds or high-emphasis text, use:
  - `neutral-850`
  - `neutral-900`
  - `neutral-950`
- These appear black to users while remaining softer and more readable.

## Controlled Grays
- For light gray backgrounds, secondary text, borders, and muted elements, use:
  - `neutral-450`
  - `neutral-500`
  - `neutral-600`
- These maintain hierarchy without overpowering primary content or fading out.

## No Blues, Purples, or Blacks
- **Do not use blues, purples, or blacks** anywhere in the UI **unless explicitly instructed otherwise**.
- This includes:
  - Backgrounds
  - Text
  - Icons
  - Borders
  - Shadows
- These colors introduce unintended mood, brand conflict, or visual noise when used by default.

## Accent Color Usage
- The provided accent color is the **only exception** to the neutral-only rule.
- Use it intentionally for:
  - Primary actions
  - Active states
  - Key highlights
- Never replace neutrals with the accent color for layout or large surfaces.

## Summary
- Neutrals first, always
- No pure black
- No blues or purples unless explicitly told
- One accent color, used with restraint

This rule exists to ensure clarity, polish, and long-term visual comfort across the entire interface.
